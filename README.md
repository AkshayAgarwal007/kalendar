# Kalendar

Kalendar is a calendar application written in C++ with the QT library for the gui. This project **is not related** with KDE, but this desktop environment is the main target of this project. I'm try to keep Kalendar as simple as possible and I want to avoid annoying dependencies (so you can easly install it everywhere).

**The project is currently under heavy development** and requires a lot of work to be ready for the first release. Stay tuned.

The final result should be something similar to gnome-calendar.

TODO:
* External plugins support
* Support iCalendar format
