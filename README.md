# Kalendar

Kalendar is a calendar application written in C++ with the QT library for the gui. This project **is not related** with KDE, but this desktop environment is the main target of this project. I'm try to keep Kalendar as simple as possible and I want to avoid annoying dependencies (so you can easly install it everywhere).

**The project is currently under heavy development** and requires a lot of work to be ready for the first release. Stay tuned.

The final result should be something similar to gnome-calendar.

TODO:
* External plugins support
* Support iCalendar format [as plugin]
* Notify system [as plugin]
* Year view for long-term events

### Motivation
I need to schedule my time in a more efficient way. I don't like online calendar like google calendar for the privacy issues. I looked for some good calendar application, but seems there are just a couple of such calendar. Two main calendar applications are: gnome-desktop and korganizer. Their problems are a lot of dependencies and complicated compilation. So I decided to develop a simple but powerful calendar with painless compilation, without dependencies and desktop environment indipendent.
